# 50 poems

### Artists:
Guillermo Gudiño and Georgia Wall

### Project timeline:
Monday, Jan 2. 2017 - Sunday, Dec 31. 2018

### Structure:
Monday... Guillermo Gudiño writes Georgia Wall a line of poetry using WhatsApp.
Tuesday... Georgia Wall responds by adding another line to the poem.
This continues; artists alternating adding a line to the poem each day of the week.
The 7-line poem ends on Sunday.
Next Monday... Georgia Wall will begin the next poem using the same structure as above.

*Note: if an artist cannot contribute his/her line (because of lack of internet access or other extenuating circumstances) that line will be skipped.
This means that not all poems will necessarily follow the 7-line structures.
